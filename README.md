This Android-based Health Information System empowers doctors to digitally manage client health programs (TB, Malaria, HIV) through an intuitive mobile interface. 
Built with Firebase for real-time data sync and featuring an embedded NanoHTTPD API server, 
the solution enables client registration, multi-program enrollment, instant search, and profile viewing -
all optimized for offline-capable clinic use. The clean MVVM architecture includes JUnit/Espresso tests, 
while the RESTful API (/api/clients) exposes JSON data for integration with external systems. 
Setup requires Android Studio and Firebase configuration, with demo API calls available via simple curl commands.
